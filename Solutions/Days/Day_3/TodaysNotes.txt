Welcome to  MEAN Fullstack Bootcamp

Good morning.


A  new start with new experience.

Having music along with learning is best , I feel.
I hope you also like this new approach.


	Agenda for Today:

			Only Javascript Programming 
			Art of Programming
			FullStack Application Development
			Modular Approach for building solution.
			Ofcourse along with Node JS Runtime


	Pre-requisite:
			Your Curiocity and try out mindset
			And Trust 


	So Welcome to MEAN Stack to its Foundation, you know what I am talking about  

			Javascript Programming without Browser
					       without HTML
					       without CSS
					       without frontEnd
					       with Core Programming



	Compilation: Compile time
		    at the time of Compilation
		    a process of converting Source code into Exeuctable Code
		
			C lang---- .c file--------C / C++ compiler---------machine code (.exe file)
						  (cl.exe)
			hello.c---------------cl.exe----------------------hello.exe (self executable)
									  (contains machine code)
	
	Execution:  Runtime
		  at the time of running application
		  at the time of executing application

		  Executing executable code with the help of Operating System and hardware
		  Executable file is submitted for execution.
		  Operating System  launches a Kernel Object ( Process)

	Compile time:
		
		
	Runtime:
		
		Each Runtime is a process running on the top of Operating System.

		 
		1.Node JS---------is responsible for executing Javascript code (.js)  by 
				    converting it into machine code and running through OS.
			(node.exe)-----Runtime process

		2.Python-----------is responsible for executing Python code (.py) by 
				    converting it into machine code and running through OS.
			(python.exe)----Runtime process


		 java compiler: javac.exe
				 .java file into .class file
		 
		 3.JVM ------------is responsible for executing  .class file(byte code) code by 
				    converting it into machine code and running through OS.
			
			(java.exe)------java Runtime		 

		 4.C# compiler: csc.exe 		
				.cs file into  .dll file

	         CLR-------------is responsible for exeucting Compiled .NET Code( IL Code) code by
				    converting it into machine code and running through OS.
		 
			(dotnet.exe)------.net Runtime




	To run javascript:
			   you just need Javascript Engine.
			   Javascript Engine is a part of NodeJS Runtime (node.exe)


	Javascript Engine:
			 consist of interpreter ( intepretes code line  into exeuctable instruction which are run by OS Process)



	We are here to build Online Application
	We are here to build FullStack Application
	We are here to build Distributed Application
	We are here to build Complete Web Application

									.class files .jar files)

						 (Node JS
							  fs, http, events, etc.

	Defines tasks
	For Tasks we need write programs

Define your Project:


	Domain:ECommerce Domain
	Solution:Fullstack Online Shopping Portal



			Website
				contains web content (static content)
			Portal
				contains dynamic web contents
					(forms)
					(fourms)
					Personalized content 
						

	FullStacK:
			MEAN FullStack

			Node JS



Online Shopping Portal using MEAN Stack
		What are  things required out of box ?
		What are things to be developed being as developer ?

What are  things required out of box ?

		Distributed Solution

Core Functionalilities of Ecommerce Solution

		ECommerce solution would contain reusable loosely coupled modules

		Non Functional Requirements

			Best Performance
			Quick loading content
			Security
			latest content
			Responsive
		
		Functional  Requirements
			Modularity:
				decouple application functionalities in the form of resuable units (Modules)
			
			1.Product Catalog
					View products 
					View product details
					Search 
			2.Inventory
					Add , remove, update product
			
			3.Shopping Cart
					Add to Cart
					Remove from Cart
					Show all items from cart

			4.OrderProcessing
					Create Order
					GetOrderDetails
					CancelOrder
					ApproveOrder

Build Server:
	Write Program to run server.
	
What do you mean by Server ?

	Client Application---------Browser (Rich Client Application)
	Server Applicaiton---------Build Server
				    Runtime: Node JS
				    reusable modules (Libraries)
							http, fs, events, etc.
				    server will be built by Javascript Program
				    server.js



write Server side Javascript programs to build server and host Web pages of Web Application.
