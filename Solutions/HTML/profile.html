    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My attitude towards any technology is, “I don’t know it all, but I will figure it out”. I find technology fascinating due to its vast ever-changing nature. There is so much to investigate. Every day I come to work, I find out I know less. This keep my learning spirit alive.
Learning and Teaching, my passion keeps me involved in teaching and mentoring Information Technology for more than 25 years.
I started my career as Lab Faculty from 1997 for C and C++ programming. I received opportunity to conduct C, Datastructures, C++, Win 32, MFC (VC++), COM,DCOM,ATLCOM sessions for Engg. students, CDAC-ACTS students & IT developers since 1998. I started conducting corporate trainings for CDAC-ACTS centers, Corporate Houses from 1999. A role of Techical co-ordinator in seed from 2000-2003 helped me to discover my Technology mentoring and Train The Trainer capability.</p>
