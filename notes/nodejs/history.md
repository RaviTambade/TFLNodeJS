# Node.js Architecture


**Node.js** is a powerful, open-source JavaScript runtime that lets developers run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, typically on the server side. Built on Chrome's fast V8 engine, it allows you to create scalable, high-performance applications using a non-blocking, event-driven architecture. With Node.js, you can build everything from REST APIs to real-time chat apps, all using JavaScript—the same language used for building the frontend—making it a popular choice for fullstack development.

Even though only 14 years old, Node.js has emerged to be one of the most popular web development frameworks in the last decade. We can write Javascript code outside the browser to create server-side web applications that are non-blocking, lightweight, fast, robust and scalable.

###  **A Brief History of Node.js**

Just to give you a sense of the timeline here, the World Wide Web started around 34 years back. Javascript was born about 29 years ago and about the same goes for PHP (30 years). Node.js, on the other hand, is only 14 years old. Despite its relatively short run, Node.js has done wonders for developer organizations around the world.

Ever since Javascript has launched, there have been attempts to utilize Javascript for the back-end, for example, Netscape tried to do something similar with Netscape Livewire. These however turned out to be unsuccessful. Around 2004 onwards, when the first waves of Web 2.0 were starting out, Javascript started getting a lot of traction owing to the visions of a modern web experience. Since Javascript was (and is) the most widely used client-side programming language, browsers competed and pushed to create the most optimized Javascript engines for best performance. One of these engines was Chrome V8, on top of which Node.js was later built. As a result of this momentum, Javascript flourished, and so did the V8 engine. 

In 2009, in the right place, at the right time, Node.js was born. Ever since then, Node.js development has skyrocketed. Despite competition from pioneers like PHP and Advance Java, Node.js has emerged to be the more preferred server-side choice for many applications today, thanks to it’s asynchronous I/O, event-driven architecture, light-weightedness, speed, scalability and the fact that it uses the most popular programming language i.e. Javascript. Today, Node.js servers are used in production for applications and enterprises that cater to hundreds of millions of users worldwide - Netflix, Linkedin, Microsoft, GoDaddy, Paypal and many more. To give you an estimate of it’s popularity, Node’s package manager, NPM, registers billions of downloads each week.

Node.js is very actively maintained, thanks to its enormous community of users and developers. This means that there’s abundant support on the internet if you get stuck somewhere and need some help with your code, or any web development advice in general.
