# Why A Good Setup Matters for Node.js Apps

Now that we have a clear understanding of the mechanics of how Node.js works under the hood, let’s segue into the more applied side of things and look at what constitutes an intelligent Node.js project.

A good project structure setup is the key to any software engineering pipeline and lays a solid foundation for an effective application. When starting out with a new Node.js project, a well-defined structure laid out beforehand provides a clear bird’s eye view of your system’s working. It also helps you organize your business logic, services, API routes, data models, etc. in a systematic fashion. This elicits coherence and clarity about the role and place of various components in your project.

A sound structure allows you to break down and simplify a complex system into smaller, more intelligible modules that draw a better picture of how your application works internally. The following are the key points that an ideal project setup entails - 


- Coherent, well-defined structure for clarity
- Reusability, modularity, and separation of concerns
- Simplicity for better understanding
- Easy debugging and maintenance
- Automated testing, logging mechanisms
- Employing best programming, development principles

To establish a set of ground rules and guidelines to consider when building Node.js applications, let us dive into the next section where we discuss the best practices for development in Node.js projects.

## Best Practices for Node.js Development 

The internet is full of tutorials, documentation, blogs and videos covering the basics of web development. But usually, information (and importance) about best practices is something that we learn along the way, as we build more apps, as we fail and succeed along the way.

the most important aspects of web development into a set of bullet points to always consider when building web applications with Node.js. These points bring forth insights about how certain design decisions can pay a huge dividend in the course of your web development lifecycle.
