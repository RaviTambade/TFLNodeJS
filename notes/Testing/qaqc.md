## âœ… **Advanced Testing Topics**

### 1. **Continuous Integration (CI) with Testing**

Continuous Integration (CI) refers to the practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated builds and testing. The goal is to ensure that code changes do not break the existing functionality and that any defects are caught early.

#### **Key Concepts of CI:**

* **Version Control System (VCS)**: Code is stored in a VCS like **Git** (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
* **CI Server**: A server (e.g., **Jenkins**, **CircleCI**, **Travis CI**) automatically detects code changes and runs builds and tests.
* **Automated Testing**: Every time code is pushed, automated tests (unit, integration, UI) are run to ensure the quality and correctness of the code.
* **Build Process**: The process of compiling, testing, and packaging code into executable artifacts.

#### **Steps to Implement CI with Testing:**

1. **Version Control Setup**:

   * Create a repository on **GitHub**, **GitLab**, or **Bitbucket**.
   * Set up branches for development and production.

2. **CI Tool Setup (Jenkins Example)**:

   * **Install Jenkins** on a server (can be done locally or in the cloud).
   * Set up **Jenkins Pipeline** to trigger automated tests every time new code is committed.

     * You can use the **Jenkinsfile** (a script defining the steps of your pipeline) to define the build and test process.

3. **Integrate Testing Framework**:

   * Integrate testing frameworks (e.g., **JUnit**, **Selenium**, **TestNG**) into the Jenkins pipeline.
   * Example: Create a **JUnit** test class and ensure Jenkins runs it each time code is committed.

4. **Automated Test Execution**:

   * On every commit, Jenkins will automatically build the project, run tests (unit, integration, UI), and report the results.

5. **Notification**:

   * Jenkins can notify the team (via email, Slack, etc.) about the build and test status (success/failure).

#### **Example Jenkins Pipeline Configuration (Jenkinsfile)**:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/your-repo/project.git'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install'  // Build the project using Maven
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'  // Run unit tests using Maven
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh './deploy.sh'  // Deploy the app (optional)
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            junit '**/target/test-*.xml'  // Publish test results to Jenkins
        }
        success {
            echo 'Build and tests passed!'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Tests failed. Please fix the issues.'
        }
    }
}
```

**Tools for CI**:

* **Jenkins**: Open-source automation server for CI/CD.
* **Travis CI**: Integrated with GitHub, great for open-source projects.
* **GitLab CI**: Built into GitLab, allowing CI/CD from within the GitLab platform.
* **CircleCI**: Cloud-based CI tool for fast builds and tests.

### 2. **Automation Frameworks**

Automation frameworks provide a structured approach to testing and help with **code reusability**, **maintainability**, and **efficiency**. There are several frameworks available depending on the language and testing type.

#### **Types of Automation Frameworks**:

* **Linear/Scripted Framework**: The simplest form, where each test case is written as a script with hard-coded steps. It's not flexible or reusable.

  * **Use Case**: Simple projects or small teams.
  * **Tools**: Selenium, TestNG.

* **Modular Framework**: The application is divided into smaller modules, and each module has its own scripts. This improves reusability.

  * **Use Case**: Medium complexity projects.
  * **Tools**: Selenium, JUnit.

* **Data-Driven Framework**: This framework uses external data sources (Excel, CSV, databases) for running tests with different sets of input data.

  * **Use Case**: Testing with multiple input scenarios (e.g., login with different usernames/passwords).
  * **Tools**: Selenium, TestNG, Apache POI (for Excel integration).

* **Keyword-Driven Framework**: The test scripts are written in terms of keywords, which are then mapped to specific actions (e.g., "click", "enter text").

  * **Use Case**: When non-technical users want to write tests (e.g., test designers, QA analysts).
  * **Tools**: Selenium, Cucumber.

* **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Framework**: BDD frameworks allow writing tests in natural language (using tools like **Cucumber** or **SpecFlow**) that describe the behavior of the application.

  * **Use Case**: Collaboration between developers, QA, and business stakeholders.
  * **Tools**: **Cucumber**, **Gherkin**.

#### **Example of a Selenium Test using BDD (Cucumber + Gherkin)**:

**Feature File (login.feature)**:

```gherkin
Feature: User Login

  Scenario: User logs in successfully with valid credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters valid credentials
    Then the user is redirected to the dashboard
```

**Step Definition File (LoginSteps.java)**:

```java
import io.cucumber.java.en.*;

public class LoginSteps {
    WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

    @Given("the user is on the login page")
    public void userOnLoginPage() {
        driver.get("https://example.com/login");
    }

    @When("the user enters valid credentials")
    public void userEntersCredentials() {
        driver.findElement(By.id("username")).sendKeys("validUser");
        driver.findElement(By.id("password")).sendKeys("validPass");
        driver.findElement(By.id("loginButton")).click();
    }

    @Then("the user is redirected to the dashboard")
    public void userRedirectedToDashboard() {
        assert driver.getCurrentUrl().contains("dashboard");
    }
}
```

**Tools for Automation Frameworks**:

* **Selenium WebDriver**: For browser automation.
* **TestNG / JUnit**: For running tests and organizing them.
* **Cucumber**: For BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) testing with Gherkin syntax.
* **Appium**: For mobile application automation (iOS and Android).

## âœ… **Step-by-Step Guide: Setting Up CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins and Selenium**

### **1. Set Up Jenkins for CI/CD**

#### **Step 1: Install Jenkins**

* Go to the official Jenkins [download page](https://www.jenkins.io/download/).
* Install Jenkins on your local machine or a server.

  * **Windows**: Download the `.msi` installer.
  * **Linux/macOS**: Follow the instructions for your OS.

#### **Step 2: Start Jenkins**

* Once Jenkins is installed, start Jenkins by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser.
* On first launch, Jenkins will ask for an unlock key, which you can find in the Jenkins installation directory (e.g., `/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`).

#### **Step 3: Set Up Jenkins Plugins**

* **Install necessary plugins** for Selenium and testing:

  * **Selenium WebDriver Plugin**: This plugin allows you to run WebDriver-based tests.

  * **TestNG Plugin**: This plugin allows Jenkins to understand and report TestNG test results.

  * **GitHub Plugin**: Integrates Jenkins with GitHub to automatically trigger builds on code changes.

  * Go to `Manage Jenkins` > `Manage Plugins` and install the above plugins.

---

### **2. Create a Project in Jenkins**

#### **Step 1: Create a New Job**

* From the Jenkins dashboard, click **New Item**.
* Enter a name for your job (e.g., `Selenium-Automation`), and select **Freestyle Project**.
* Click **OK**.

#### **Step 2: Configure GitHub Integration**

* Under the **Source Code Management** section, select **Git** and enter your repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`).
* Add your GitHub credentials if necessary.

#### **Step 3: Set Build Triggers**

* In the **Build Triggers** section, select **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling** to trigger builds automatically when code is pushed to GitHub.

#### **Step 4: Configure Build Step**

* Under **Build**, select **Execute Shell** (or **Execute Windows batch command** depending on your OS).
* Add a command to **build your project**. For example, if you're using **Maven**, you might add:

  ```bash
  mvn clean install
  ```
* This will run **Maven** to build your project and generate test reports.

#### **Step 5: Add Post-Build Actions**

* After the build, Jenkins can publish test results.

  * In the **Post-build Actions** section, select **Publish JUnit test result report** and enter the path to your test results (e.g., `target/test-*.xml` for Maven-generated reports).

---

### **3. Set Up Selenium Test Automation in Jenkins**

#### **Step 1: Write Selenium Test Script**

* Create a basic **Selenium test script** in your Java project. Here's a simple example:

  **Test Login (LoginTest.java)**:

  ```java
  import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
  import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;
  import org.testng.Assert;
  import org.testng.annotations.Test;

  public class LoginTest {
      @Test
      public void testLogin() {
          WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
          driver.get("https://example.com/login");
          
          // Example test: Check page title
          String title = driver.getTitle();
          Assert.assertEquals(title, "Login Page");
          
          driver.quit();
      }
  }
  ```
* Make sure that **ChromeDriver** (or another driver) is available and accessible in the Jenkins environment.

#### **Step 2: Run Tests in Jenkins**

* Once the build and tests are configured, Jenkins will automatically run your Selenium tests every time the code is pushed to GitHub.

#### **Step 3: View Test Results**

* Jenkins will provide detailed test results in the build report. You can view the status (passed/failed) for each test case.

## âœ… **Step-by-Step Guide: Set Up Advanced Automation Framework (Cucumber + Selenium)**

### **1. Set Up Cucumber with Selenium**

#### **Step 1: Add Dependencies (Maven Example)**

* Add **Cucumber**, **Selenium**, and **JUnit/TestNG** dependencies to your `pom.xml` (if you're using Maven).

  ```xml
  <dependencies>
      <dependency>
          <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
          <artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId>
          <version>6.10.4</version>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
          <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
          <artifactId>cucumber-spring</artifactId>
          <version>6.10.4</version>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
          <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
          <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
          <version>3.141.59</version>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
          <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
          <artifactId>junit-jupiter-api</artifactId>
          <version>5.7.1</version>
      </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  ```

#### **Step 2: Write Gherkin Scenarios**

* Write your test cases using **Gherkin syntax**. Create a `.feature` file.

  **Feature File (login.feature)**:

  ```gherkin
  Feature: User Login

    Scenario: User logs in with valid credentials
      Given the user is on the login page
      When the user enters a valid username and password
      Then the user should be logged in and redirected to the dashboard
  ```

#### **Step 3: Create Step Definitions**

* Create a Java class with **Cucumber step definitions** to map the Gherkin steps to code.

  **LoginSteps.java**:

  ```java
  import org.openqa.selenium.By;
  import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
  import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;
  import io.cucumber.java.en.*;

  public class LoginSteps {
      WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

      @Given("the user is on the login page")
      public void userIsOnLoginPage() {
          driver.get("https://example.com/login");
      }

      @When("the user enters a valid username and password")
      public void userEntersValidCredentials() {
          driver.findElement(By.id("username")).sendKeys("validUser");
          driver.findElement(By.id("password")).sendKeys("validPass");
          driver.findElement(By.id("loginButton")).click();
      }

      @Then("the user should be logged in and redirected to the dashboard")
      public void userIsRedirectedToDashboard() {
          assert driver.getCurrentUrl().contains("dashboard");
          driver.quit();
      }
  }
  ```

#### **Step 4: Configure Cucumber Runner Class**

* Create a **Cucumber runner class** to run the tests with JUnit.

  **TestRunner.java**:

  ```java
  import io.cucumber.junit.Cucumber;
  import io.cucumber.junit.CucumberOptions;
  import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

  @RunWith(Cucumber.class)
  @CucumberOptions(features = "src/test/resources/features", glue = "stepDefinitions")
  public class TestRunner {
  }
  ```

---

### **2. Integrate Cucumber with Jenkins for CI/CD**

#### **Step 1: Configure Jenkins for Cucumber Testing**

* Similar to Selenium, create a Jenkins job to build and run your **Cucumber** tests.
* Use the **Maven** build step to execute Cucumber tests:

  ```bash
  mvn clean test
  ```

#### **Step 2: Publish Cucumber Reports in Jenkins**

* In the **Post-build Actions** section, add **Publish Cucumber Results**.
* This will allow Jenkins to display detailed **Cucumber test results** in the build report.

#### **Step 3: Test Results and Reporting**

* Jenkins will now run the **Cucumber tests**, generate the report, and show detailed results.
